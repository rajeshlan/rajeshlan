👋 Hey there, I’m Rajesh!

🚀 Passionate about cracking the code to financial freedom—literally.

💡 Currently diving deep into Python and the mysterious world of quant finance.

🎯 On a mission to turn my code into cash (still a work in progress, but getting there!).

🛠️ Always up for collaborating on cutting-edge projects that push the boundaries of tech and finance.

✨ Fun fact: When I'm not coding, I'm probably daydreaming about algorithms that could change the game
